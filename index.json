Since the biography in the beginning is good to keep short, I explain my academic interests and motivate my research deeper in this post. I started as a Ph.D. student in April 2022 at the University of Helsinki in the computer science department in the Unified Database Management Systems research group. Before my Ph.D. studies, I worked as a research assistant in the same group.\nIf you check my previous publications, I have not been researching quantum computing but applications of category theory for multi-model databases. Usually, a relatively small science community can understand your research specifically. In my case, I felt that the community was even smaller than usual. Understandably, the database research community is not familiar with applied category theory. On the other hand, the results were not very deep from a category theory point of view. Although applied category theory is exciting and topical, I noticed that category theory and databases are relatively narrow research topics.\nI have studied special linear algebraic topics in my thesis, e.g., quadratic forms and Pfister forms. After all, quadratic and Pfister forms are matrices, and their manipulation requires advanced algebraic results. Because quantum computing is theoretically based on linear algebraic structures, I can relatively easily apply my previous knowledge and adopt quantum computing in my research. I have not officially studied quantum computing because our university had only a single quantum computing course, and I did not find it in my student times. Our department has plans to extend quantum computing teaching, which is a very positive direction. I believe that I will surely be a part of the development of education.\nI do not believe that quantum computing will bring immersive computational speedups in the near future. In terms of speed, the promises of quantum computing are sometimes over-hyped. When I represent my research, I aim to be realistic regarding its possibilities. On the other hand, time is just a single ‘‘parameter’’ that we want to minimize. Sometimes we should move our focus away from time efficiency. Whereas we can keep arguing if quantum computing can perform faster than classical, we can be sure that quantum computing is much more energy efficient than classical. We have read news about bitcoin mining which consumes a tremendous amount of energy, and the data centers require their own nuclear powerplants before their energy consumption is covered. Energy will be literary a disappearing resource in the world. Also, we are currently living in the very last moments when we can still do something against the climate crisis. Here, quantum computers can save a part of the field because their energy consumption is at the level of your fridge at home. Sometimes you might want to trade speed with energy.\nThe second motivation to add quantum computing along with databases and category theory is the conceptual model. Quantum computing is a fundamentally different computing model. Learning to think quantumly is a fascinating (and very long) journey! Quantum computing is intriguing, even if we never find any serious applications for it.\nHow can we apply quantum computing in data management? That is my research’s core question, and the possible ideas deserve their own post. I have written a detailed Ph.D. workshop paper for VLDB 2022 conference. If it gets accepted, I will link it here. Anyway, I want to point out that I want to continue researching the possibilities of category theory in the context of quantum computing and databases. There is already extensive research connecting category theory and quantum computing. The pioneer of the field is Bob Coecke. Research linking quantum computing and databases is still in its initial steps, and as far as I know, the database community is not aware of its possibilities.\n","date":1650240000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1650240000,"objectID":"05319e50a5a119ae087bd73ce3334729","permalink":"https://valteruo.github.io/post/research-proposal/","publishdate":"2022-04-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/research-proposal/","section":"post","summary":"Welcome to my academic webpage!

The theorem provides an upper bound for a stability index of a real variety. The theory is based on real closed fields which generalize real numbers. A real variety is a subset of a real closed field that is defined by polynomial equalities. Every semi-algebraic set is defined by a boolean combination of polynomial equations and inequalities of the sign conditions involving a finite number of polynomials. The basic semi-algebraic sets are those semi-algebraic sets that are defined solely by the sign conditions. In other words, we can construct semi-algebraic sets from the basic semi-algebraic sets by taking the finite unions, intersections, and complements of the basic semi-algebraic sets.\nThen the stability index of a real variety indicates the upper bound of numbers of polynomials that are required to express an arbitrary semi-algebraic subset of the variety. The theorem of Bröcker and Scheiderer shows that such upper bound exists and is finite for basic open semi-algebraic subsets of a real variety.\nThis work aims to be detailed in the proofs and represent sufficient prerequisites and references. The first chapter introduces the topic generally and motivates to study the theorem. The second chapter provides advanced prerequisites in algebra. One of such results is the factorial theorem of a total ring of fractions. Other advanced topics include radicals, prime ideals, associative algebras, a dimension of a ring, and various quotient structures.\nThe third chapter defines real closed fields and semi-algebraic sets that are the fundamental building blocks of the theory. The third chapter also develops the theory of quadratic forms. The main result of this chapter is Witt’s cancellation theorem. We also shortly describe the Tsen-Lang theorem.\nThe fourth chapter is about Pfister forms. Pfister forms are special kinds of quadratic forms that we extensively use in the proof of the main theorem. First, we define general Pfister forms over fields. Then we develop their theory over the fields of rational functions. Generally, Pfister forms share multiple similar properties as quadratic forms.\nThe fifth chapter represents one- and two-dimensional examples of the main theorem. These examples are based on research that is done on constructive approaches to the theorem of Bröcker and Scheiderer. The examples clarify and motivate the result from an algorithmic perspective. Finally, we prove the main theorem of the work. The proof is heavily based on Pfister forms.\n","date":1645574400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1645574400,"objectID":"d83cc45ad74349a756241c061f060211","permalink":"https://valteruo.github.io/publication/masters_thesis/","publishdate":"2022-04-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/masters_thesis/","section":"publication","summary":"In this work, I prove the theorem of Bröcker and Scheiderer for basic open semi-algebraic sets.

Rigorous modeling of transformations is a complex problem. The data and schema transformation field is scattered with multiple different transformation frameworks, tools, and mappings. These are usually domain-specific and lack solid theoretical foundations. Our first goal is to define category theoretical foundations for relational, graph, and hierarchical data models and instances. Each data instance is represented as a category theoretical mapping called a functor. We formalize data and schema transformations as Kan lifts utilizing the functorial representation for the instances. A Kan lift is a category theoretical construction consisting of two mappings satisfying the certain universal property. In this work, the two mappings correspond to schema transformation and data transformation.","tags":["multi-model data","category theory","data transformations","relational data","graph data","document data"],"title":"A Formal Category Theoretical Framework for Multi-model Data Transformations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Valter Uotila","Lu, Jiaheng","Gawlick, Dieter","Liu, Zhen Hua","Das, Souripriya","Pogossiants, Gregory"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1629446400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629446400,"objectID":"1ceb144abaa6b896316d8dbf103e2a15","permalink":"https://valteruo.github.io/publication/multicategory_demo_system_vldb21/","publishdate":"2022-04-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/multicategory_demo_system_vldb21/","section":"publication","summary":"The variety of data is one of the important issues in the era of Big Data. The data are naturally organized in different formats and models, including structured data, semi-structured data, and unstructured data. Prior research has envisioned an approach to abstract multi-model data with a schema category and an instance category by using category theory. In this paper, we demonstrate a system, called MultiCategory, which processes multi-model queries based on category theory and functional programming. This demo is centered around four main scenarios to show a tangible system. First, we show how to build a schema category and an instance category by loading different models of data, including relational, XML, key-value, and graph data. Second, we show a few examples of query processing by using the functional programming language Haskell. Third, we demo the flexible outputs with different models of data for the same input query. Fourth, to better understand the category theoretical structure behind the queries, we offer a variety of graphical hooks to explore and visualize queries as graphs with respect to the schema category, as well as the query processing procedure with Haskell.","tags":["multi-model databases","category theory","functional programming"],"title":"MultiCategory: Multi-Model Query Processing Meets Category Theory and Functional Programming","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Valter Uotila","Lu, Jiaheng","Gawlick, Dieter","Liu, Zhen Hua","Das, Souripriya","Pogossiants, Gregory"],"categories":null,"content":"Invited short paper for SEAData workshop at VLDB 2021.\n","date":1629421200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629421200,"objectID":"497f8e0404794c7ba998d2653e3add23","permalink":"https://valteruo.github.io/publication/seadata21/","publishdate":"2022-04-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/seadata21/","section":"publication","summary":"Invited short paper for SEAData workshop at VLDB 2021.","tags":["visionary","multi-model databases","category theory","functional programming"],"title":"Multi-model Query Processing Meets Category Theory and Functional Programming","type":"publication"}]
