Rigorous modeling of transformations is a complex problem. The data and schema transformation field is scattered with multiple different transformation frameworks, tools, and mappings. These are usually domain-specific and lack solid theoretical foundations. Our first goal is to define category theoretical foundations for relational, graph, and hierarchical data models and instances. Each data instance is represented as a category theoretical mapping called a functor. We formalize data and schema transformations as Kan lifts utilizing the functorial representation for the instances. A Kan lift is a category theoretical construction consisting of two mappings satisfying the certain universal property. In this work, the two mappings correspond to schema transformation and data transformation.","tags":["multi-model data","category theory","data transformations","relational data","graph data","document data"],"title":"A Formal Category Theoretical Framework for Multi-model Data Transformations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Valter Uotila","Lu, Jiaheng","Gawlick, Dieter","Liu, Zhen Hua","Das, Souripriya","Pogossiants, Gregory"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1629446400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629446400,"objectID":"1ceb144abaa6b896316d8dbf103e2a15","permalink":"https://valteruo.github.io/publication/multicategory_demo_system_vldb21/","publishdate":"2022-04-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/multicategory_demo_system_vldb21/","section":"publication","summary":"The variety of data is one of the important issues in the era of Big Data. The data are naturally organized in different formats and models, including structured data, semi-structured data, and unstructured data. Prior research has envisioned an approach to abstract multi-model data with a schema category and an instance category by using category theory. In this paper, we demonstrate a system, called MultiCategory, which processes multi-model queries based on category theory and functional programming. This demo is centered around four main scenarios to show a tangible system. First, we show how to build a schema category and an instance category by loading different models of data, including relational, XML, key-value, and graph data. Second, we show a few examples of query processing by using the functional programming language Haskell. Third, we demo the flexible outputs with different models of data for the same input query. Fourth, to better understand the category theoretical structure behind the queries, we offer a variety of graphical hooks to explore and visualize queries as graphs with respect to the schema category, as well as the query processing procedure with Haskell.","tags":["multi-model databases","category theory","functional programming"],"title":"MultiCategory: Multi-Model Query Processing Meets Category Theory and Functional Programming","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Valter Uotila","Lu, Jiaheng","Gawlick, Dieter","Liu, Zhen Hua","Das, Souripriya","Pogossiants, Gregory"],"categories":null,"content":"Invited short paper for SEAData workshop at VLDB 2021.\n","date":1629421200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629421200,"objectID":"497f8e0404794c7ba998d2653e3add23","permalink":"https://valteruo.github.io/publication/seadata21/","publishdate":"2022-04-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/seadata21/","section":"publication","summary":"Invited short paper for SEAData workshop at VLDB 2021.","tags":["visionary","multi-model databases","category theory","functional programming"],"title":"Multi-model Query Processing Meets Category Theory and Functional Programming","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Valter Uotila","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.
