  <h2>
      Bio
  </h2>
  <p>
    I am soon graduating master's student in mathematics at the University of Helsinki in Finland. I have been focusing on algebraic topics in mathematics such as semi-algebraic geometry and category theory.
    I have been working as a research assistant in the unified database management systems research group in the computer science department where we have developed some initial ideas on how to
    model multi-model databases with applied category theory.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please note that this webpage is not a CV but rather a glance at my academic career, research, and my research interests. 
    It also serves as an archive for the presentations that are otherwise difficult to share but asked often afterward.
  </p>

  <h3>
      Currently working on
  </h3>
  <p>
    I am increasingly interested in quantum computing. Currently, the database community does not realize the possible applications of quantum computing in our field. I am interested in researching these possibilities.
    Since I have a category-theoretic background, I am also enthusiastic about applying and modeling quantum computational topics using category theory. There is a lot to learn!

    We are writing a survey paper on model and data transformations between relational, property graph and RDF graph instances.

  <h2>Thesis</h2>
  
  <p>
    Currently finalizing my thesis with a title: Theorem of Br√∂cker and Scheiderer: Stability index of real varieties.
    </p>
    <p>
        I wrote my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uQDYpEgb95iqKVxiSfE_uw3Nuo5KdsAa/view?usp=sharing"> bachelor thesis </a> about Tikhonov's theorem (in Finnish).
        I proved the theorem following Tikhonov's original proof, Zorn's lemma, Alexander's sub-basis theorem and filters.
